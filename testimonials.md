> As we sit on the cusp of the one-hundred year anniversary of the discovery of insulin and the end of type 1 diabetes as a rapidly fatal illness, we are now on the cusp of the next great moment in type 1 diabetes: the end of type 1 diabetes as an all-encompassing, persistently gnawing, cognitive, emotional, and physical drain on people with type 1 or the parents of children with type 1. While the discoveries and advances of the past decades have led to massive improvements in health outcomes for type 1 diabetes, the burden of these current methods of care remains immeasurable. Although the final great discovery in type 1 diabetes, a cure, remains elusive, closed-loop insulin delivery represents the possibility of tremendous relief for the lives of millions.  
>   
> This book by Dana Lewis about the development of the first DIY closed loop insulin delivery system represents the convergence of this thrilling moment in type 1 diabetes along with a pivotal moment in healthcare overall – the end of medical paternalism. Dana Lewis, writing from the patient perspective, is not the traditional author of a medical book, but represents the leading edge of a new wave in healthcare innovation. The OpenAPS and \#WeAreNotWaiting movements have inspired and will show the way for the rest of healthcare in that they are patient-driven, crowdsourcing expertise from across the world, run on a stack of commodity technologies rather than a single enterprise technology, and using personalized systems and algorithms rather than one-size-fits-all treatments.

> Dana’s story is captivating and raw. Her advice and tips are straightforward, practical, and hard-earned. **I will immediately recommend this book not just to people looking to use a DIY closed loop system, but also to anybody looking to improve their grasp on the management of type 1 diabetes, whether patient, caregiver, or healthcare provider.**
